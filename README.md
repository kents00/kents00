I've been learning to code for four years and enjoy making 3D models and add-ons in blender. I also enjoy modding games and creating blogs.

For more information on 3D modeling methods as well as programming hints and suggestions, visit my [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/kents_workof_art) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@kent_edoloverio).
